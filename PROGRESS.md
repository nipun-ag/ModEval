**docs: Create comprehensive documentation system**
- Created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with complete technical reference: folder structure, all API endpoints with request/response schemas, all 6 models with architecture/training data/strengths/limitations, Context Engine logic with threshold formulas, Policy Alignment scoring, Disagreement detection definitions, Platform modifiers table, Content Type modifiers table, Strictness modifiers table, Environment variables reference, Local development setup, Deployment details, Known limitations, Technology stack, File-by-file reference, Data flow diagram, Security considerations, Future extension points.
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with compressed codebase documentation (< 150 lines) for AI assistance: what the app is, tech stack, project structure, coding conventions, what not to touch, where to find things, self-updating meta instruction, commit format, task preparation checklist, never-do-without-asking rules, common task patterns, current state, known limitations.
- Updated `README.md`: Removed Project Structure, API Endpoints, Running Locally, Environment Variables, and Deployment sections (moved to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Kept public-facing content: What Is This, Why I Built This, What It Does, Models Used, Try an Example, Platform Policies, Methodology, UI Features, Tech Stack, Future Improvements, About the Builder.
- Created `PROGRESS.md` (this file) to track dated changelog entries.

**Rationale:** Documentation system allows future work to be faster by centralizing context. Long technical details moved to dedicated files, keeping README focused on public overview. CLAUDE.md enables AI to understand project quickly without reading 5 separate files. PROGRESS.md provides historical record of changes.
